Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:



General

At least four different sorting algorithms

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input

What is a stable sorting algorithm


Requireents

The code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

Global variables are not allowed

No more than 5 functions per file

Unless specified otherwise, use the standard library is not allowed. Any use of functions like printf, puts, â€¦ is totally forbidden.

All the function prototypes should be included in the header file called sort.h

A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
